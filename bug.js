This error occurs when you try to use a component that hasn't been imported or defined correctly.  It's a common error, especially when working with complex component structures or when refactoring code.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
<MyComponent />
```

This will produce the error if `MyComponent` is not imported and defined within the scope where it is used.  It could be due to a typo in the component name, an incorrect import path, or the component simply not being defined at all.
