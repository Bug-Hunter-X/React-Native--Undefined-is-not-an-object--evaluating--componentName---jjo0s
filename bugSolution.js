To fix this, ensure that the component is correctly imported and defined within the component's scope.

```javascript
// Correct usage
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

// ... within the component where you use MyComponent
<MyComponent />
```

**Double-check the following:**

1. **Correct import path:** Verify the path to your component's file is accurate.  Relative paths are generally preferred.
2. **Component name:** Ensure there are no typos in the component's name in both the import statement and the JSX.
3. **Component definition:** Ensure that the component (`MyComponent` in the example) is correctly defined and exported from its file.
4. **Case sensitivity:** Verify that the component name's casing matches exactly between the import and usage.
5. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a simple clean and rebuild of the project can resolve this issue.
